# Entity Targeted Sentiment Analysis (Quantum Criticism)
![Pipeline Image](images/etas_pipeline.png)

## Purpose
The tool aims to use a more efficient and explainable rule-based system to analyze entity-targeted sentiment. It uses a heuristic approach to determine the general sentiment aimed at a certain entity, for instance: 

**"The person hit the baby."** sees a negative sentiment aimed at the person and a small positive aimed at the baby. Our goal is to develop a tool that can automatically map that.

## QC Research

This tool is part of a greater project.

### General Goal

How sentiment of a named entity progresses within a single article and the consistency/iterations of these trends over time.

Offer a greater understanding the agenda of all news (no matter the source) based purely on intra-article case.
